GigyaSDK
========

A repository to hold versioned instances of the Gigya iOS SDK. (http://developers.gigya.com/035_Mobile_SDKs/010_iPhone)

Create a PR if you wish to add new versions as they come out or older versions if you have them archived.

To add a version, create a folder whose name is the version at the root of the master branch. Put the GigyaSDK.zip file inside with nothing else. Commit that folder and zip file and create a PR.
